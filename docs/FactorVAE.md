## FactorVAE



**Definition of di*sentangled representation*** 

> a representation where a change in one dimension corresponds to a change in one factor of variation, while being relatively invariant to changes in other factors  -- Bengio



$\beta$-VAE has been approved as a unsupervised disentangling method based on variational auto encoder

the drawback of it is that **reconstruction quality must be sacrificed** in order to obtain better disentangling.

the goal of this paper is to obtain a better **trade-off between** disentanglement and reconstruction.
